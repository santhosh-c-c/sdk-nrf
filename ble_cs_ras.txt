```BLE Channel Sounding

> CS uses Phase-Based Ranging (PBR) and Round-Trip Time (RTT) for precise ranging. PBR measures phase differences across multiple frequency channels, while RTT calculates signal travel time, enhancing security and accuracy

Roles

> Initiator: Initiates the process by sending CS_SYNC packets and computes distance from Reflector responses
> Reflector: Responds to CS_SYNC packets, reflects signals, and provides data via GATT notifications

nRF RAS Implementation

> Initiator(Central) connects to the Reflector via RAS UUID
> Configures Channel Sounding, subscribes to ranging_data, and sends CS_SYNC packets
> Processes responses with cs_de_calc for distance estimates

> Reflector(Peripheral) advertises RAS UUID
> Responds to CS_SYNC packets, updates GATT characteristics, and notifies the Initiator

cs_de.c

> cs_de_calc: Function that processes IQ samples for distance
> calculate_dist_ifft: Uses IFFT to compute distance from phase data
> calculate_dist_d_spaced_kay_f: Applies a phase slope method for PBR distance calculation
> Round-Trip Time (RTT) - Measures how long a signal takes to travel and return for distance accuracy using calculate_dist_rtt

Security - Keeps ranging data encrypted and authenticated.

> bt_conn_set_security: Sets BLE connection security to Level 2 (L2CAP)
> bt_le_cs_security_enable: Turns on Channel Sounding-specific encryption
> security_changed: Callback that confirms when security is active

Initiator and Reflector

> bt_le_cs_set_default_settings: Sets role with enable_initiator_role = true (Initiator) or enable_reflector_role = true (Reflector)
> subevent_result_cb: Handles results from signal exchanges (both roles)
> ranging_data_cb: Manages ranging data from CS_SYNC packets (both roles)

> PBR and RTT distances are computed by cs_de_calc using calculate_dist_ifft, calculate_dist_d_spaced_kay_f, and calculate_dist_rtt
